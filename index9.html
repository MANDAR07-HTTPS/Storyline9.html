            <h3><b><i>Shivaji Maharaj was a very fair worker, believed in secularism, and that is why he had chosen a Muslim, Miyan Mir, for being the head of the Tofkhana, the artillery department. The act of Shivaji showed very well that he did believe in offering posts to people based on their merits rather than considering their religious background. His administration did not give importance to religion but gave more emphasis to the skills and expertise that fall under their big policy of harmony and tolerance among all the subjects. It promoted harmony and effectiveness in the Maratha Empire, revealing Shivaji Maharaj's progressive, nondiscriminatory leadership, which bestowed stability and success upon his rule.</i></b></h3>
